# Phlex examples

This repository contains examples of the use of the [Phlex framework](https://github.com/framework-r-d/phlex).

## Building this repository

To use the code in this repository, first install it:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Framework-R-D/phlex-examples.git
```

Now create a build directory:
```console
mkdir build-phlex-examples
cd build-phlex-examples
```

The repository can now be easily built by activating [the environment you created when installing Phlex](https://github.com/Framework-R-D/phlex/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md#creating-and-installing-the-phlex-environment):

```console
spack env activate my-phlex-environment
spack load cmake
cmake ../phlex-example
make -j
```

## Running the code

You should now be able to run a simple `phlex` job:

### Job with C++ algorithms

```console
$ phlex -c ~/phlex-examples/test-cpp-workflow.jsonnet
Using configuration file: /.../phlex-examples/test-cpp-workflow.jsonnet
[2025-12-22 13:17:51.496] [info] Number of worker threads: 24

```

### Job with Python algorithms

To run a job that uses a Python algorithm, the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable must be adjusted to include the directory with the Python module:

```console
$ PYTHONPATH=$(realpath ~/phlex-examples):$PYTHONPATH
$ phlex -c ~/phlex-examples/test-py-workflow.jsonnet
Using configuration file: /home/knoepfel/phlex-examples/test-py-workflow.jsonnet

> - Cannot be written to output files
> - Must belong to the `"job"` data layer
